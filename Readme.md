# Honey Press
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/honeypress

## Simple
A very simple mod I made because honeycomb is SO annoying to process. 

Pressing 10 honeycomb will give 9.89 Liters of honey... supposed to be 10, but internal rounding causes it to be off.

Pressing only 5 will give a nice round 5 liters. Twice as much pressing but no loss. And still much easier than doing it by hand.

I'm aware other mods might do this same thing, but I keep mine up as not everyone uses those mods and still might want this feature. (including me)

## Code?
While not a code mod, github offers an exceptional way to manage my mods. It's also a place you can post issues on the tracker.
